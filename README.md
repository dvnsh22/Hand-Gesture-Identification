# Hand-Gesture-Identification
<p> Gesture recognition determines the user intent through the recognition of the gesture or movement of the body or body parts. With the advent of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, machines can be made to recognise hand gestures, thereby making human-computer interaction quite convenient. </p>
<p> This project aims at dealing with recognition of user's different hand gestures taken as input through webcam and performing different operations on their OS accordingly. </p>

## Methodology
Data preparation is done on local machine and model training is done on Google Colab. <br /> 
Steps involved during implementation of the project are as follows:
<ol>
<li> To detect and recognise hand from the webcam feed, <i>MediaPipe</i> library in Python has been used. </li>
<li> Dataset has been prepared by capturing multiple images for different gestures. </li>
<li> The dataset has been used for training the model. </li>
<li> The trained model has been integrated with the operating system (Windows) to perform different operations. </li>
</ol>
